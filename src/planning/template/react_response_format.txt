You should only respond once in JSON format as described below.

Response Format:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "text": "thought",
        "reasoning": "reasoning",
        "plan": "- short bulleted\n- list that conveys\n- long-term plan",
        "criticism": "constructive self-criticism",
        "speak": "thoughts summary to say to user",
    },
    "command": {"name": "command name", "args": {"arg name": "value"}},
}

Ensure that the response content adheres to the JSON format so that it can be successfully parsed by the Python json.load function.
